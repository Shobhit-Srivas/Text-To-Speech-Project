## 🔊 Text to Speech (A–Z Alphabetical Characters)

Text to Speech (A–Z) is a lightweight web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that converts English alphabetical characters (A to Z) into spoken audio. The application allows users to type a single alphabet character, which is then pronounced clearly while displaying a corresponding image for better visual understanding.



## 🚀 Key Features

🔠 Alphabet Input (A–Z) – Supports only English alphabetical characters

✍️ Character-Based Speech – Speaks the entered alphabet instantly

🔊 Audio Output – Uses browser-based speech synthesis for pronunciation

🖼️ Image Display – Shows a relevant image for each alphabet

⚡ Real-Time Interaction – Immediate response on character input



## 🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5 – Application structure

CSS3 – Styling and responsive layout

JavaScript (ES6) – Logic and speech synthesis using Web Speech API



## 🎯 Project Objective

This project was developed to practice JavaScript event handling, input validation, and the Web Speech API, while creating an educational and interactive tool for learning English alphabets.



## 🔮 Future Enhancements

🧒 Alphabet words (A for Apple, B for Ball)

🎙️ Voice and pronunciation control
